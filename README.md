# holonomic-quantum-grassmanian-through-plucker-embedding-and-control-pulse

at first phase of this project i have worked on holonomic quantum computation and  grassmanian plucker embedding majorana star for getting anticoherrent subspace for cnot gate to make it noise reslient.
i worked on this papers -
1.https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02592

2.Toponomic Quantum Computation-  C. Chryssomalakos∗ and L. Hanote,E. Guzmán-Gonzále  E. Serrano-Ensástig

3.Stellar Representation of Grassmannians- C. Chryssomalakos∗ and L. Hanote,E. Guzmán-Gonzále  E. Serrano-Ensástig

4.Continuous-variable geometric phase and its manipulation for quantum computation in a superconducting circuit

5.Demonstration of a non-Abelian geometric controlled-NOT gate in a superconducting circuit

6.When geometric phases turn topological


then i have started working on extracting control pulse to design noise resilient gates which are dynamically corrected gates.i have worked on curvature and torsion and dynamics

1.Dynamically corrected gates from geometric space curves

2.Geometric formalism for constructing arbitrary single-qubit dynamically corrected gates


at last i have worked on wigner negativity and it's possible connection with magic states and negative otoc
